The current implementation leverages os.walk() to traverse the hierarchy and then post-processes the directories and files by filtering out the ignored ones. In theory, performing the traversal in-house—i.e., writing a custom recursive walk that applies the ignore rules during the traversal—could be more efficient, particularly in cases where large portions of the directory tree are ignored.

Below are some detailed considerations:

---

### 1. Early Pruning of Unwanted Directories

A custom implementation can decide not to descend into a directory as soon as it determines that the directory (or its path based on ancestor patterns) should be skipped. This early pruning can save significant time and resources compared to os.walk(), which will list every directory before your filtering logic kicks in.

- **Current Approach:**  
  os.walk() generates lists for all directories and files. While the filtering happens in-place (modifying the dirnames list), the underlying call to os.walk() must at least read the directory metadata.
  
- **Custom Traversal:**  
  By incorporating ignore rule checks during the recursion, you can decide not to even list or open directories that are not needed. This "short-circuit" approach would be particularly beneficial for deeply nested directory trees with many levels that are meant to be ignored.

### 2. Overhead and Control

Using a custom traversal provides finer control over how and when checks are performed:

- **Optimized Resource Use:**  
  Rather than filtering after listing, the traversal logic can avoid hitting directories that match ignore conditions, potentially reducing I/O overhead.
  
- **Customizability:**  
  With in-house traversal, you could integrate additional custom filters (such as depth limits or specialized file matching) with less concern about working around os.walk() constraints.

### 3. Trade-offs and Maintenance

However, it's important to also consider the following trade-offs:

- **Code Complexity:**  
  os.walk() is battle-tested and handles a lot of edge cases for you (like symbolic links, permissions errors, etc.). A custom implementation might need to re-implement or handle these cases, which could increase code complexity and maintenance overhead.
  
- **Performance Gains vs. Implementation Effort:**  
  If the majority of the directories and files are not ignored or if the directory tree isn’t extremely large, the performance gains might be marginal compared to the reliability and simplicity of using os.walk().
  
- **Testing and Debugging:**  
  A custom traversal must be rigorously tested to ensure that it handles all cases correctly—especially since Git’s ignore rules can be complex. The current implementation benefits from leveraging a well-known library (os.walk()) to handle much of the heavy lifting.

---

### 4. Conclusion

While a custom hierarchy traversal can potentially be more efficient—especially through early abandonment of ignored paths—in many scenarios the performance boost might not justify the additional code complexity and maintenance challenges. In scenarios where directory trees are massive and the cost of listing directories is significant, a custom traversal that integrates the ignore logic directly could be beneficial. Otherwise, the current design using os.walk() with in-place filtering is typically sufficient, providing both clarity and reliability.

In summary, the decision depends on the specific needs and typical use cases for iwalk.walk(). For extremely large repositories with extensive ignore rules, integrating the hierarchy traversal might yield better efficiency, but for most applications, the current design strikes a good balance between simplicity and performance.
